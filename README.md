Hello There!

My name is Tuan Le, a highly motivated Computer Science Coop student, and the following are my projects:

Project 1 | ColourGame + PianistGame: 
These games were my first attempt at web development using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Project 2 | Watt Street Bistro Restaurant website:
Contracted to design and build the web's interface for Watt Street Bistro Restaurant, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript (React).

Project 3 | Sentiment Analysis:
Based on newspaper headline associating with public companies whose stock tickets are provided as inputs, return time plots that demonstrate their popularity.
